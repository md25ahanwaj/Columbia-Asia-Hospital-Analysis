## Project Description
Columbia Asia Hospital is renowned for its exceptional patient-centered care and advanced medical expertise. This project aims to analyze hospital data to improve strategic decision-making and patient experience. The focus is on understanding department performance, wait times, patient demographics, and revenue to provide actionable insights for operational improvements and strategic planning.

## Data Overview
The project utilizes two primary datasets:
- **Transactional Data:** Includes details on doctor-patient interactions such as patient race, age, appointment fees, and assigned doctors.
- **Billing Data:** Contains comprehensive billing information including total bills, doctor names, patient IDs, and departments.

Both datasets, each with over 6000 rows, were imported into Microsoft Power BI for analysis. Initial data transformation ensured cleanliness and relevance for in-depth analysis and actionable insights.

## Methodology
**Analytical Methods:** Utilized Power BI for data analysis and visualization.

**Tools Used:** Power BI Desktop, Power Query Editor, DAX.

**Steps Taken:**
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats using Power Query Editor.
- **Data Enrichment:** Joined datasets to enable comprehensive analysis.
- **Measure Creation:** Developed DAX measures for key performance indicators (e.g., SUM, AVERAGE, RELATED, CALCULATE).
- **Visualization:** Created various visualizations to present insights.

## Problem Statement
The hospital sought key insights to:
- Identify suitable departments for new hires.
- Develop strategies for patient discount eligibility.
- Analyze total and department-wise revenue.

## Insights and Recommendations
**Department Visits:** The bar chart shows the distribution of patient visits across departments, with General Practice leading (7.2K visits) followed by Orthopedics (1.0K). This insight aids in resource allocation and strategic planning.

**Visitor Gender Distribution:** The pie chart reveals a balanced gender distribution (Men: 51.05%, Women: 48.69%), reflecting the hospital's inclusive environment.

**Department-wise Satisfaction Scores:** Gastroenterology leads with a satisfaction rating of 5.2. Recommendations include:
- **Staffing:** Increase doctors in General Practice and Orthopedics to handle high patient volumes and reduce wait times.
- **Efficiency:** Improve staffing to enhance service delivery and patient satisfaction.
- **Revenue:** Better staffing may lead to increased revenue through improved patient care.

**Discount Strategies:** Recommend offering discounts based on patient satisfaction scores, with those scoring above 6 eligible for discounts. This approach compensates for the lack of specific cost data.

**Hospital Profitability:** Current data indicates a profit margin of 0, suggesting a need for financial strategy adjustments.

**Shift Assignments:** Proposed shift allocation includes:
- Morning Shift: Dr. Jackson and Dr. Williams (8:00 AM - 2:00 PM)
- Evening Shift: Dr. Smith (2:00 PM - 8:00 PM)
This optimized shift scheduling addresses high patient traffic and enhances operational efficiency.

## How to Use This Project
- **Open Power BI File:** The project is available as a Power BI file with cleaned data, visualizations, and interactive dashboards.
- **Explore the Dashboard:** Use the interactive elements to delve into various data insights.
- **Review Visualizations:** Analyze charts and graphs to understand key metrics and trends.
- **Apply Filters:** Customize the analysis by applying filters based on specific criteria or time periods.

## Conclusion
The analysis of Columbia Asia Hospital's dataset has provided valuable insights into patient demographics, departmental performance, and revenue. Key findings include the need for strategic staffing, targeted discounts, and optimized shift scheduling. Implementing these recommendations will enhance operational efficiency and patient satisfaction, driving informed decision-making and supporting the hospital's growth.
